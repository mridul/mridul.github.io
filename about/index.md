I am currently working towards a Master's in Computer Science at Columbia University. My primary interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, NLP and Information Retrieval. I will be graduating in December 2017. 

I am spending my summer working with the Twitter Search Quality team. Previously I have worked at Microsoft on Bing and Cortana relevance, at Instamojo on payments, and at LinkedIn-Slideshare on recommendations.

At Columbia, I have been a part of the History Lab with Owen Rambow; and David Blei's Lab. Here's my [resume](http://www.columbia.edu/~mk3908/MridulKapoor.pdf).
